##Overview

This project builds an end-to-end data pipeline for Kara Solutions to analyze Ethiopian medical businesses using Telegram data. Task 0 establishes a reproducible project environment with Git, Docker, and secure secret management. Task 1 implements a Telegram scraping pipeline to extract messages and images from public channels (chemed_chem, lobelia4cosmetics, tikvahpharma) and store them in a partitioned Data Lake, with a FastAPI interface for triggering scraping and accessing data.
